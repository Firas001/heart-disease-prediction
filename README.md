# Heart Disease Prediction

using Machine Learning
# About the project

This project focuses on training a machine learning model for predicting heart disease. To achieve the best possible result, the data has been trained using three different algorithms:
* Logistic Regression
* SVM (Support Vector Machine)
* Random Forest




# Learning Resource

This project was completed as part of the final lab of an Artificial Intelligence course at Misurata University's Faculty of Information Technology. The primary resource utilized from [thecleverprogrammer.com](https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/11/10/heart-disease-prediction-using-machine-learning), and the dataset was sourced from [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset). After implementing necessary adjustments and improvements to achieve optimal results, a comprehensive Arabic report was uploaded to [ Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v62QrMNJe7GEWeeinV9ewi-mqjMWfpFBnR80F6XT8M0/edit?usp=sharing).

## Installation

To execute interactive python notebook on your local device, we recommend using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install requirements.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
I recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) for your project. It's designed specifically for data science and scientific computing, and includes a package manager and environment management tools that make it easy to install and manage packages and dependencies. Plus, it comes with pre-installed libraries and tools like Jupyter Notebook, Spyder, and RStudio, so you can get started quickly and easily.
